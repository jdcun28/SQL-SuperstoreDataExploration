# SQL-SuperstoreDataExploration
This repository contains a data analysis project that explores and visualizes sales data from a fictional superstore. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and storytelling using real-world data.
The data used in this project was obtained from the Superstore Dataset on Kaggle website.

The analysis in this project reveals insights into the sales performance of the superstore, including trends over time, top-selling products, and top-performing regions. The visualizations in the project provide a clear and concise way to present the findings.
